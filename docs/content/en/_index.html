OSPREY is computational protein design software developed by [the Donald Lab](https://www.cs.duke.edu/donaldlab/) at Duke University. It has been used to prospectively predict resistance mutations, design antibodies targeting HIV, and redirect enzymes to target new substrates, among other design and analysis tasks.

A full listing of peer-reviewed papers that OSPREY has played an important role in can be found [here](www.todo.com).
